## About

Just a simple tool for people thinking about moving to a different country for a job to calculate how much money they would make and save.
Based on COL statistics from Numbeo and tax numbers from talent.com. There are probably tax incentives specific to a country that is not taken into account. (Georgia 1-5% tax, Taiwan 50% tax reduction on income above 3 million NTD etc.)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
